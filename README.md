# Building_Energy_Efficiency
Predict the Efficiency of a building using Machine Learning Techniques.

# Overview
This project focuses on predicting the energy efficiency of buildings by leveraging machine learning models. By analyzing crucial parameters like wall area, roof area, and glazing area, the model aims to estimate the heating and cooling loads necessary for maintaining energy efficiency. The results can significantly contribute to designing sustainable buildings and reducing energy consumption. This project looked into assessing the heating load and cooling load requirements of buildings (that is, energy efficiency) as a function of building parameters.

## Objective
- Develop regression and neural network (Deep Learning) models to accurately estimate energy requirements.
- Assess the model's performance using evaluation metrics such as R² Score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## Key Concepts

- **Energy Efficiency**: Efficient use of energy to minimize waste in buildings.
- **Regression Models**: Supervised learning techniques used to predict continuous values.
- **Feature Engineering**: Understanding the contribution of different building features towards energy efficiency.

## Dataset Features:
- Relative Compactness, Surface Area, Wall Area, Roof Area, Overall Height, Orientation, Glazing Area, Glazing Area Distribution.
- **Target Variables**: Heating Load (HL), Cooling Load (CL)

## Tools and Libraries

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries:**
  pandas - Data manipulation,
  numpy - Numerical operations,
  scikit-learn - Model development and evaluation,
  matplotlib/seaborn - Data visualization.

## Detailed steps involved:
  ### 1. Data Loading and Exploration:
  - Import necessary libraries.
  - Load the dataset using pandas.
  - Display the first few records to understand the dataset structure.
  
  ### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Perform pair plots and correlation matrix visualizations to explore relationships between features and target variables.
  - Identify key features that influence heating and cooling loads.
    
  ### 3. Data Preprocessing

  - Normalize the dataset to bring all features to a similar scale, which improves model performance.
  - Use MinMaxScaler for scaling.
  - Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance effectively.

 ### 4. Model Development
Train and evaluate multiple models for predicting heating load and cooling load :

- Linear Regression:
A simple and interpretable model that assumes a linear relationship between input features and the target variable.
Achieved an R² score of 0.85.

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regressor
Averages the target values of the k-nearest neighbors in the feature space.
Performed moderately with an R² score of 0.89.

- Ridge Regression
A linear model with L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.
Achieved an R² score of 0.87.

- Lasso Regression
Similar to Ridge, but applies L1 regularization to drive coefficients to zero, performing feature selection.
Gave an R² score of 0.86.

- Polynomial Regression
Extends linear regression by adding polynomial features to capture non-linear relationships.
Provided a slightly higher accuracy with an R² score of 0.91.

- Polynomial Regression with Ridge
Combines polynomial regression with Ridge regularization to control variance.
Improved accuracy, reaching an R² score of 0.92.

- Linear SVR (Support Vector Regression)
Fits data within a margin of tolerance and minimizes errors.
Achieved an R² score of 0.84.

- SVM (Support Vector Machine) for Regression
Uses non-linear kernels to capture complex relationships.
Outperformed with an R² score of 0.93.

- Decision Tree Regressor
Splits data recursively to minimize variance.
Performed well, achieving an R² score of 0.90.

### 5. Model Evaluation
- Evaluate the performance of both models using R² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- Compare results to determine the best-performing model.

## Conclusion
The model demonstrated strong performance with an overall classification accuracy of 94%. This indicates that the developed machine learning models can reliably predict building energy efficiency and assist in designing more energy-conscious buildings. The high accuracy reflects the robustness of the models, suggesting that the combination of regression and classification techniques successfully captures the intricate relationships between building features and energy load requirements.

## Future Work
- Ensemble Methods: Implement ensemble techniques such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or XGBoost to enhance model performance further.
- Deep Learning Models: Explore neural networks and deep learning architectures (such as CNNs or LSTMs) to capture more complex patterns in the data.
- Feature Expansion: Introduce new features related to material properties, ventilation, and insulation to improve model accuracy.
